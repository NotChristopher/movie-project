# movie-project
A React porfolio showcase app, using TMDB api for movie search results and trending movies

# How I made this app !

 1. The design happened while building this app,using bootstrap5 components for navbar, hero banner and movie cards
 2. I used trello to break down all the tasks needed to build this app, including to list known bugs to fix as I go along. Link to: https://trello.com/b/XiUpt3Iv/movie-project
  
# Important things you might want to see !

  1. /components/home.js is where you can see the source code to filter for trending movies
  2. /components/movieview.js is where you can see how I mapped the details of selected movies
  3. /componnets/searc.js is where you can see how I mapped out all the search results that displays dynamically as you start searching
  
# What I would like to add if I had more time? !

  1. I would ad a banner on the movieview.js to show the co starts of the selected movie
  2. Add a survey for users to filter through the api for movies that is recommend to view. Using genre, favorarite cast members and by selecting liked movies from a pool of           dynamic movie choices based on previous selections.
   
# How to navigate the source code !

  1. app.js shows how every component renders and shows how I filter through the api with search text
  2. /components/home.js filters for trending movies
  3. /components/navbar.js is the navbar component, using bootstrap 5.
  4. /components/movieview.js is how I map and display movie overview, a poster img, rating , runtime
  5. /components/search.js is how I went about handling how to display search results. I used a bootstrap 5 card component.
  6. /components/notfound.js is the 404 page
  7. /components/hero.js is just a hero banner I created using Bootstrap 5
  8. /components/about.js is just a brief word about the project and a link to my github to view this project's source code.
  
  
# Final word !

  Thanks for the time you took to review my code, I am highly motivated to start as a professioanl developer and any feedback would be greatly appreciated
